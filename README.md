# dotfiles
A place for me to dump dotfiles 

To install run `bash install.sh` from inide the repository folder. This will create symlinks in the home directory and prompt before removal if the file alreay exists.

`slick-greeter.conf` goes in `/usr/lightdm/`.

Backgrounds can go in `usr/local/share/backgrounds/` with symlinks called `background` and `greeter-background`
